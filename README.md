# Python_infared-PC-controller
To use this you just need to set the actual COM port of your arduino which can be found in the arduino IDE, and run the script.  The IR receiver goes in the 5v or 3.3v of your Arduino (either has worked for me), the ground in the ground, and the vcc in the second digital port on your Arduino.  Nothing needs to be uploaded to the Arduino for this script to work.

This currently just opens an app, but of course can be used to do basically anything with python.
